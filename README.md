# â›½ Pakistan Petrol Price Prediction (2026â€“2035)

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting petrol prices in Pakistan using historical monthly data from **2010 to 2025**. Various regression models were trained to forecast petrol prices for the years **2026â€“2035**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Rows**: 185  
- **Columns**: `Date`, `Petrol Price (PKR per litre)`  
- No missing or duplicate values

### Data Transformations:
- Converted `Date` to datetime format
- Extracted `Year` and `Month` from `Date` column

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Average Petrol Price per Year**  
   A line plot was created showing a steady increase in average petrol prices from 2010 to 2025.

2. **Month-wise Petrol Price (2021â€“2025)**  
   A detailed monthly price trend plot showed the rising cost in recent years, especially after 2022.

## ðŸ¤– Models Trained

The models were trained using `Year` and `Month` as input features:

| Model               | RÂ² Score  |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Gradient Boosting   | 0.9898    |
| Random Forest       | 0.9872    |
| XGBoost             | 0.9550    |
| KNN                 | 0.9512    |
| Lasso Regression    | 0.5304    |
| Ridge Regression    | 0.5304    |
| Linear Regression   | 0.5303    |

## ðŸ”® Future Price Predictions (2026â€“2035)

### Gradient Boosting (Best Performer)
Predicted the same value (â‰ˆ 280.30 PKR) for every year, due to the model's nature of not extrapolating beyond training data.

### Other Model Insights

- **Random Forest**: Predicted constant price â‰ˆ 280.71 PKR for all years.
- **XGBoost**: Predicted constant price â‰ˆ 281.30 PKR for all years.
- **KNN**: Slightly varied predictions due to averaging neighbors.
- **Linear Models (Lasso, Ridge, Linear Regression)**:  
  Predicted linearly increasing prices (e.g., 233 â†’ 343 PKR) due to their extrapolation capabilities.

## ðŸ“Œ Model Behavior Summary

| Model Type         | Behavior on Future Data      |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Tree-Based         | High accuracy, flat outputs  |
| KNN                | Slight variation             |
| Linear Models      | Linear extrapolation, lower RÂ² |

### Key Insight:
> **Tree-based models are highly accurate on known data but struggle with extrapolation. Linear models extrapolate better but may underfit.**
